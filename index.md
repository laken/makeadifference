Donald Trump's election and impending administration represent a huge threat to policies, values, and institutions many of us consider fundamentally American. Women's rights and reproductive freedom, immigrant rights, marriage equality and LGBTQ issues, climate change and the environment, civil liberties and freedom of expression, free press – all of these and more are coming under attack. Over the next four years we will need to fight harder than ever to preserve the gains made in these areas.

This is a list, frequently updated, of organizations fighting the good fight in these areas that need your support.
